Welcome to leaks for my new game, or the start of the company, DoorsJeff Entertainment, below are some leaks and gameplay ideas that are confirmed to be used in the finished product of the game
1. Rabbit OS: this is a lore filled little detaile that makes things easier to find, if you click e on the mouse of the desk on floor 1, then it takes you to the monitor, where you then can click on mp3 files and listen to voice recordings of the daycare employees
2. the taser: A mechanic used to short circuit electrical panels.
More Soon!
